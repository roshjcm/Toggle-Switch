# Toggle-Switch
Goal: Learning how to make a toggle switch and basics of css/html. 

At first, I used a sample toggle switch found on Queness (design by Marco Biedermann).
I then decided to play with it and modify it to understand all parts of the code.
The comments you might see (especially in main.css) come from observations I had while 
playing with the settings and from research I made on various websites to better 
understand css/html. 

I might make one or two toggle switches from scratch later on to make sure I can apply 
the concepts I just learned (and for the sake of trying new designs haha).
